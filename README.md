### How to use

The same way as regular phpass; check out the embedded phpdoc for info on the extras.


### Motivation

For obsolete reasons, I wanted to implement client side Javascript asymmetric encryption on my PHP web app. 

So I did some research and the most reasonably fast and tested library was PGEncrypt by Herbert Hanewinkel, but it was old (2005) and lacked a public repository or a reliable distribution channel compatible with composer for quickly embedding on PHP web apps and tracking any changes/updates/patches or extensions, so I packaged it all and this project was born.

### Acks
